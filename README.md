# WP4T42-01-AI PULP

Capabilities for AI supported adaptability in PULP.

## Description

The aim of this component is to enhance to existing PULP platforms to support resource allocation in the context of AI workloads. 

One of the main applications for PULP-based systems is ML inference on the edge. Further computing capabilities for inference on the edge are continuously being added to the system (e.g. hardware accelerators, instruction set architecture extensions). Moreover, new features on the software stack are investigated to efficiently map a specific application on the resources available at hardware level. 

## Objectives

The component satisfies the objective of the task through: 
* Exploring resource allocation optimizations on the PULP platform 
* Extending computing capabilities for inference on the edge 

## Prerequisites, Installation and Usage

Prerequisites, installation and usage described in the PULP (PULPissimo + accelerator) repository.
